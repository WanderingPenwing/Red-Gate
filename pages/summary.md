## I am self hosting some stuff

**12 GB of RAM, 2 servers, and one braincell.**

You never knew it, but itâ€™s not that hard to self host some utilities, using 
an old computers lying around. I use nixos *(yay, linux !)* on it, but you 
could do the same on windows !

**Here is my grandma's recipe :**

- chop some containers using [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- mix the ports with [nginx](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-nginx-handbook/)
- grab a domain name
- and bake the urls with [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

## Hardware

I host my stuff on two servers :

- bathhouse (an old hp laptop with 4GB of RAM) which is always on (because low power consumption)
- boiler (an old hp desktop with 8GB of RAM) which I turn on only part of the day
