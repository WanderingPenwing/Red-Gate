## I am self hosting some stuff

**8 GB of RAM, four cores, and one braincell.**

You never knew it, but itâ€™s not that hard to self host some utilities, using 
an old computer lying around. I use nixos *(yay, linux !)* on it, but you 
could do the same on windows !

**Here is my grandma's recipe :**

- chop some containers using [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- mix the ports with [nginx](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-nginx-handbook/)
- grab a domain name
- and bake the urls with [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
