## A dashboard ‚å® 

Being as new to docker container as I was (and still am), I wanted a pretty 
dashboard to motinor and tinker with the containers I run on the server. 
I chose [portainer](https://www.portainer.io/") for its beginner-friendliness, 
and it never failed me (yet).

###### searxng

## A search engine üîç

I am not a big corporate fan *(as a linux user, surprising)*, so I was 
unhappy about relying on google for my searchs. Not because of its hunger for data 
but merely because I want to search for informations and not accept whatever google 
says the best result is. [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) 
is a **self-hostable meta search engine** (a bit of a mouthful). What it means 
in practice is that it will sort results according to *multiple sources* 
instead of just one (and you can choose the sources !)

## Some movies üé¨

As a huge movie watcher, which I collect very legally, I had to make myself a 
collection. But why not share it with my friends ? So I use my server to host a 
[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) instance

###### seafile

## A file manager üìÅ

While I use a lot scp (not the foundation, [the command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp)),
I like to have my own remote file drive. Following the move away from google as a 
search engine, I want to be free of google drive as well.
